# Alchemy Lang
**NOTE:** This is a work in progress, it might be broken :P

This is Alchemy Language (ALCL), or also known as "Another Language (to) C Language".
This is a language that is designed to be compiled into the C language (as it's intermediate language) and then compiled into machine code.
This means that the language has the ability to easily interface with C libraries and code.
